# Flappy-Bird-Game
The game features a side-scrolling environment where the player controls a bird that must navigate through gaps between pipes. The bird moves upward when the player taps a key (e.g., spacebar) and gradually falls due to gravity. Colliding with pipes or the ground ends the game.

Key features:

Game loop: Handles events, physics, and rendering.

Gravity & Jump mechanics: Simulates realistic movement.

Randomized pipes: Ensures dynamic gameplay.

Score system: Increments when passing through pipes.

Restart option: Allows replaying after a game-over.
